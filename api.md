# Framework API
The framework services come with an API, which almost automates the communication with RedisIO, RabbitMQ, MongoDB and the outer world.

## Basic service interfaces
REST, Message, getNext, put, statistics, etc

The main parts of each component service are the following:

- A REST class
- A Service class
- A Worker class
