# OpenZoo
A framework for distributed stream/batch processing

Information on installation and usage can be found in the <a href="http://openzoo.org" target="_ext">OpenZoo site</a>.

OpenZoo is an open-source, MIT licensed, distributed, stream/batch processing framework. OpenZoo enables the development of processing topologies with minimum configuration on easy-to-use User Interfaces. Multiple languages and cross-platform support enables the creation of complex topologies, deployed either in cloud infrastructures or shared in available PCs in a lab environment. The current distribution consists of a java service template, a management GUI and several test services for demonstrating the use of the framework. Templates for C++ and Python will be soon available.
