1) Download the whole repository, containing the following services:

OpenZUI: The GUI to the OpenZoo framework
OpenZooService: The basic service functionality, to be inherited by all services
ServerResources: A web service for retrieving server capacity/load information, to be installed on every OpenZoo server
ImageDownloader: A dummy service for downloading images
MongoManager: A test service for accessing MongoDB
TwitterListener: A test service for wrapping the TwitterStream API
URLUnwrapper: A test service for unwrapping short URLs
Researcher: A test service for forwarding user requests

2) Run Tomcat 7 server on all available servers and create a password protected user on each tomcat server.

3) Install RedisIO on a server.

4) Open projects with Netbeans 8.

5) Build projects, starting by ServerResources, since it needs to be included in the OpenZUI war later. This is going to be done automatically (on -post-dist).

6) Edit OpenZUI/web/config.json:
	i) update keyvalue.host and keyvalue.port with the RedisIO server and port
	ii) update localRepository with a folder with read/write permissions for the tomcat user, anywhere on the server where OpenZUI will be installed.
	iii) update demouser.username and demouser.passwd if necessary

7) Deploy OpenZUI project to a tomcat server. Everything else can be done through OpenZUI (http://TOMCAT_SERVER:TOMCAT_PORT/OpenZUI/).
